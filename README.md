<h2>About</h2>
<p>The No Database Blog Application is a simple blog web app built using Express JS, Node JS, bodyParser, and Bootstrap. This project demonstrates how to create a blog application without using a database, relying instead on arrays and hash-based storage for data management. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Post Creation:</strong> Users can create and submit new blog posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing Posts:</strong> Display a list of existing posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Post Management:</strong> Edit and delete posts using in-memory data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is part of Section 26: "Create a Blog Web Application" from Angela Yu's course, <em>"The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp"</em>. It focuses on basic web application development techniques and serves as a foundation for understanding how to manage application data without a database.</p>
<p>Please remember to run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies before starting the server.</p>
